# IMPORTANT NOTE: If you've decided to copy my mutt configuration from my web
# site please have the good sense to change these values before you go live
# with your new configuration. If you don't you'll be pretending to be me
# and neither of us really want that; it probably reflects badly on both of
# us. Also note that there are other parts of the config that you should check
# and deal with in a similar way and for similar reasons.
